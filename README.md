This is the code for my personal autonomous robotics project, designed to autonomously navigate and map out its surroundings while simultaneously collecting environmental data
and overlaying it onto the same map.

NOTE: The project is still in progress. The code on GitLab is out of date due to something getting messed up earlier in the process. I plan on fixing it up soon, but as I just started college it will take some time, hopefully before 2020.
